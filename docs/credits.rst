The atactk package was built by the Parker Lab at the University of
Michigan, with contributions from:

* Stephen Parker

The trim_adapters utility is based on a script by Jason Buenrostro
(see `the original ATAC-seq paper`_: Buenrostro, Jason D; Giresi, Paul
G; Zaba, Lisa C; Chang, Howard Y; Greenleaf,
William J. 2013. *Transposition of native chromatin for fast and
sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins
and nucleosome position*. Nat Meth 10, 1213â€“1218.)
